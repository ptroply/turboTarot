The Divinatory Art of Tarot
---------------------------
The tarot is a collection of playing cards whose use dates back to the 15th century. Tarot cards have been used to play many historical card games, but they are most well known as a tool for predicting the future or discovering hidden knowledge about oneself. The tarot consists of a standard playing card deck featuring 52 "minor" cards divided between four suits: Wands, Swords, Cups, and Pentacles. Additionally, the tarot features 22 "major" cards: The Fool, The Magician, The Heirophant, etc.

Players may draw a number of cards from the tarot and find meaning in each "spread" through their placement, numerical value, and art. There are many tarot decks with different styles of artwork, but the most recognizable is the Rider Waite Tarot Deck.

This application is for entertainment purposes only.
